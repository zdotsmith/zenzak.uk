## Questions to tailor your project

- Which industries are you prioritising (ecommerce, consumer electronics, furniture, tourism/museums, D2C, B2B)?
- Do you prefer fixed‚Äëprice packages up front, or custom quotes after discovery?
- Any standout projects we can shape into case studies?
- Should AR be a core selling point or an add‚Äëon?
