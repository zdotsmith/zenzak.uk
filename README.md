## Solutions

### Product Design, Modeling, and Launch-Ready Visuals

I’m a photographer, engineer, and designer turned 3D artist. I build detailed, high-quality models with a focus on clean topology—then light, render, and animate them so they’re impossible to ignore.

*   **Concept Modeling & Sculpting**
    From sketch to clean 3D geometry. Rapid ideation models, hard-surface and organic sculpting, and Subdivision Surface modeling to solve proportions and ergonomics for confident reviews.

*   **High-Fidelity Surfacing & Texturing**
    Models ready for their close-ups. Clean polygonal modeling, detailed sculpting, and meticulous UV unwrapping for flawless texture application.

*   **Retopology & UV Mapping**
    Optimized models for any application. Efficient retopology for clean, animatable geometry and expert UV mapping for distortion-free texturing.

*   **CMF & Lighting Studies**
    Get the material story right. Realistic materials, texture authoring, and studio/lifestyle lighting from a photographer’s perspective.

*   **Hero Renders & Photo Composites**
    Centerpiece imagery that sells. 8K hero shots, transparent variants for web and print, and photo-real composites that blend real-world photography with CG precision.

*   **Explainers & Interactive 3D**
    Clarity for reviews, sales, and documentation. Exploded views, mechanism breakdowns, and embedded 3D/AR viewers for web and trade shows.
